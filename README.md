### More About the Project
Being an avid gamer and having a lot of friends that I play games with on a regular basis, I started to think about how I would like a social media outlet, much like instagram, but focused around gaming. I think it would be cool for people to be able to post up there highlights for others to see and to be able to connect, meet new people, and find more people to play games with through this app.

### Remaining Goals
I couldn't quite get the login and authentication down right. I would like to get that, as well as my messaging system, finsihed and fleshed out.
